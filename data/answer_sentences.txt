I made an online payment today.
I exercise every morning.
Tomorrow is Saturday.
I bought a new pillow.
I caught a cold.
I cut the grass with a sickle.
May I have your name?
I ate some watermelon.
I worked through the night.
It’s foggy.
Please buy some fruit.
I met a friend while going to Seoul.
Please turn on the light.
This candy is sweet.
My knee hurts.
The broth is refreshing.
I got up and washed my face.
He is rich.
See you later.
One plus one is two.
I have a meeting in the morning.
It’s a ten-thousand-won bill.
The interest rate has gone up.
I went to the bank to withdraw money.
I confirmed the deposit.
A profit was generated.
I’m moving next month.
